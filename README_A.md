# NextJS-and-Prisma-Skeleton-JS

## Getting started

```
cd skeleton
npm i
```

## Getting started with prisma

In your skeleton file, create a `.env` file. In side of that file add

```
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

This is needed in order for prisma to work on your local.

Should you decide to use an upload database (So this will be a DB hosted only and shared between members) Please read the prisma docs and add accordingly
